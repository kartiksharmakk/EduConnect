## EduConnect


The EduConnect mobile application represents a
transformative approach to modern education,
leveraging advanced technology to enhance
interaction and efficiency between tutors and
students. Built on the Model-View-ViewModel
(MVVM) architecture and Kotlin programming
language, it ensures modular, scalable code for
agile development and seamless integration of new
features. Firebase powers its backend with robust
authentication, real-time database capabilities,
and cloud storage, ensuring secure data
management and enabling real-time collaboration.


Key features include QR code generation for
profile interactions, announcements, notice
boards, assignments, and chat
functionalities supporting both text and
image messages. These features streamline
communication and management processes,
empowering tutors to effectively engage
with students and optimize educational
delivery. Overall, EduConnect redefines
educational technology by fostering a
dynamic and interactive learning
environment tailored to modern educational
needs.

## Methodology

The primary programming language used is Kotlin, known for its concise syntax and powerful
features, which streamline the implementation of business logic and enhance code readability.
The user interface is crafted using a combination of XML and Jetpack Compose. XML provides a
flexible and expressive means of designing dynamic and responsive layouts, while Jetpack
Compose, with its declarative approach, allows for the creation of reusable UI components,
reducing boilerplate code and speeding up development.
Firebase serves as the backbone of the backend infrastructure, offering a suite of services that
include authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and more. Firebase Authentication is
used to securely manage user sign-ins and sign-ups, incorporating methods such as phone
number OTP and email verification. The real-time database ensures that data synchronization
across devices is instantaneous, while cloud storage handles media and file uploads efficiently.
